          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Obesity and Income</h2>
          <p>Data pulled from the <a href="https://data.census.gov/cedsci/">US Census Bureau</a> and the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/index.html">Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System</a> has shown there are clear links between health risks and factors such as income and age.  Some of these are directly correlated, while others show an inverse relationship.</p>

          <p>As you can see in the chart above, there appears to be an inverse relationship between income levels and levels of obesity.  As income decreases, people are more likely to be overweight.  States with the lowest reported average income (Arkansas, Mississippi, and West Virginia) reported the highest levels of obesity.  Areas with higher average income (Hawaii, Washington, DC) tended to have fewer incidences of obesity. More research needs to be done, but the reasons for this could include access to and the ability to afford healthier food, time to exercise, or access to health care.</p>

          <p>The data above was pulled from the 50 United States and Washington, DC in 2014.</p>
